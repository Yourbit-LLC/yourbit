# Installation Instructions
These instructions are provided for the purpose of setting up a host server or development environment for Yourbit


## 1. Install Python 3.10.5

Follow this [link to download Python-3.10.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/)

To install on windows, download and run the windows installer provided on the page.

> **Note:** If you are attempting to install python on Linux. You must download the source code from the link above and follow [these instructions here](https://github.com/Yourbit-LLC/yourbit/blob/main/docs/installation/install-python-source.md) to compile and install.

## 2. Create the virtual environment

A virtual environment allows you to create isolated Python environments for different projects, preventing dependency conflicts.

**Creating a Virtual Environment**

Run the following command in your project directory:

```sh
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder named `venv` containing the isolated environment.

Using virtual environments keeps your systemâ€™s Python environment clean and avoids package conflicts between projects.


**Additional Information:**
