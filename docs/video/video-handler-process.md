## Handling Videos API’s on Yourbit
This file is intended to explain how Yourbit interacts with video API’s to retrieve, present, and deliver your video to users on Yourbit.

# Publishing Videos
- Yourbit uses a direct upload link sent from the front end when uploading a video. Once the bit is submitted begins upload in the background.
- Yourbit will attach this upload URL to the bit being created, a webhook notification is expected from the video service. This requires a SIGNING_KEY and a PRIVATE_KEY. These can be added to environment variables
