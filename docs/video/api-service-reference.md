## **Integration Considerations**
When adding a new video provider, developers should:
1. **Modify the action map** to reflect the correct API endpoints:
   ```python
   video_service = {
       "upload_url": "https://api.newservice.com/upload",
       "webhook_status": "data.status",
       "playback_url": "https://cdn.newservice.com/{playback_id}.m3u8",
       "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.newservice.com/{playback_id}/thumbnail.png",
   }
   ```
2. **Configure API authentication**:
   - Store API keys in environment variables (`settings.py`).
   - Use secure authentication (OAuth, JWT, API tokens).

3. **Ensure compatibility with Yourbit's workflow**:
   - The service must support **direct upload URLs** or **chunked uploads**.
   - The service should provide **webhook callbacks** for processing updates.
   - The playback format must be **HLS (.m3u8) or MP4** for full compatibility.

## **Conclusion**
Yourbitâ€™s modular video service allows **flexible integration** with different providers. Developers can extend support for **new video APIs** by updating the **action map** and **authentication settings**.
