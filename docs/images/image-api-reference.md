## **Integration Considerations**
When adding a new image service, developers should:
1. **Modify the action map** to reflect the correct API endpoints:
   ```python
   image_service = {
       "upload_url": "https://api.newservice.com/upload",
       "resize_url": "https://api.newservice.com/resize?width={width}&height={height}",
       "thumbnail_url": "https://cdn.newservice.com/{image_id}/thumbnail.jpg",
       "optimization_url": "https://api.newservice.com/optimize",
   }
   ```
2. **Configure API authentication**:
   - Store API keys securely in **environment variables (`settings.py`)**.
   - Use **OAuth, API tokens, or JWT** where applicable.

3. **Ensure compatibility with Yourbit’s workflow**:
   - The service must support **resizing, optimization, and secure storage**.
   - It should offer **webhooks or API polling** for image processing status updates.
   - The output format should be **JPEG, PNG, WebP, or AVIF** for full compatibility.

## **Conclusion**
Yourbit's modular architecture supports **multiple image processing solutions**, including **third-party APIs** and **self-hosted alternatives**. Developers can **extend support** by updating the **action map** and integrating new services.
