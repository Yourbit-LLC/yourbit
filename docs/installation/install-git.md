# Installing Git on Windows

## 1: Check if Git is Already Installed

Before installing Git, check if it is already installed on your system. Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and run:

```sh
git --version
```

- If Git is installed, you'll see the version number.
- If not, you'll see an error message and can proceed to the next step.

## 2: Download Git for Windows

1. Go to the official Git website:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

2. The download will begin automatically. Once it's complete, run the `.exe` installer.

---

## 3: Run the Installer

1. Follow the installation prompts. You can use the default options for most settings.
   - Choose **Git Bash** as your terminal (for easier Git usage).
   - Keep the default text editor settings (usually **Vim** or **Notepad++**).

2. Continue through the installer, accepting default settings unless you have specific preferences.

## 4: Verify the Installation

Once the installation is complete, verify that Git was installed correctly.

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **Git Bash** and run:

```sh
git --version
```

2. You should see the Git version number, confirming that Git is installed correctly.

## Alternative Method: Install via Package Manager

If you have a Windows package manager like **winget** or **Chocolatey**, you can install Git through the command line.

### Using Windows Package Manager (winget)

```sh
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```

### Using Chocolatey (if installed)

```sh
choco install git
```

## 5: Configure Git (Optional)

Once Git is installed, you may want to set up your user details.

1. Open **Git Bash** or **Command Prompt** and run the following commands, replacing the placeholders with your own details:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

---

## 6: Check the Configuration

You can verify your Git configuration with the following command:

```sh
git config --list
```

It should display the `user.name` and `user.email` you've just set.
