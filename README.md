## 🚀 **About Yourbit**  
Yourbit is a **next-gen social media platform** focused on **privacy, decentralization, and user empowerment**.  
It offers **real-time media sharing, interactive feeds, and customizable profiles**. Our goal is to develop a platform
that balances privacy and modularity to create a community built platform that people can trust with their personal data.

🔹 **Privacy-first** – Private posts and direct messages are never used for data collection for monetization.  
🔹 **Decentralized architecture** – Fork your own mini-sites off of Yourbit or host your own version locally.  
🔹 **Built-in media support** – Photo, video, and livestreaming; requires a Video Encoding and Storage API for long-form videos and livestreaming.  
🔹 **Customizable feed** – Primarily see posts from those most important to you — your friends and family.  
🔹 **Open API** – Extend Yourbit with custom integrations.

## 📥 **Installation**

[Instructions can be found here](https://github.com/Yourbit-LLC/yourbit/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) to install for private hosting, local development, or contribution.

> **Note:** A python virtual environment is required to host locally. Make sure that you have created and activated your virtual environment before installing any dependencies. Instructions for setup are provided in the above documentation. Yourbit was developed using Python 3.10.5.

> **CDN NOTICE:** Currently, Yourbit uses third party services for delivering media, such as Mux or CLoudflare Images. Until we can develop our own CDN for video and images, we are creating an Action Map that will allow developers to remap API endpoints to their specified service when redistributing Yourbit. This feature is still in progress, but you can find an example for that [here](https://github.com/Yourbit-LLC/yourbit/blob/main/docs/modifying/action-map.md).
